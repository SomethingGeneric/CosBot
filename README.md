# CosBot
Bill Cosbot - In case you're wondering, it's not the same bot anymore as the one who's token got stolen - Matt

## Revision:
This is not a Bot but a digitization of Bill Cosby's Soul to the language of Python.

# Install:
* `git clone https://github.com/SomethingGeneric/CosBot`
* `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Usage (all files are Ubuntu only, due to the way chatterbot stores data across platforms):
* `cbot.py` trains and runs a discord bot. (Insert token on line 37)
* `improve_ai.py` trains two bots, and has them talk to each other based on a user written starting prompt
* `manual_ai.py` is a CLI way to interact with one instance of the bot.
